This project is my complete end-to-end implementation of a machine learning regression model that predicts medical insurance charges based on user details like age, BMI, smoking habits, number of children, and region.
I built this project to understand how insurance pricing works and to practice a full ML workflow — from raw data to a ready-to-use prediction model.

## 📌 1. Introduction

Healthcare insurance companies determine premium prices based on personal and lifestyle factors.
However, these prices are often complex and difficult to estimate manually.

### Goal of this project:

Build a machine learning model that can predict insurance cost using demographic and health-related variables.

This is a supervised regression problem.

## 📊 2. Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about individuals and the insurance cost they paid.
It includes the following features:

| Column       | Description                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **age**      | Age of the person                                      |
| **sex**      | Male / Female                                          |
| **bmi**      | Body Mass Index — indicates health & obesity           |
| **children** | Number of dependent children                           |
| **smoker**   | Whether the person is a smoker (Yes/No)                |
| **region**   | US region (southeast, southwest, northeast, northwest) |
| **charges**  | Final insurance cost (Target Variable)                 |

The feature charges is what we want to predict.
